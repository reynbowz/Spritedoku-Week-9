## Pory Questionnare answers
1. Do Ash's Pokemon have to be currently under his ownership, or is it just any pokemon he's ever had, no matter how briefly? 
> The pkmn must have battled under Ash's name or been caught in a pokeball by Ash. Releasing/trading away does not disqualify
2. What about previously evolved forms? ex: he had a Charmander/Charmeleon but it evolved to Charizard 
> Y - the pre-evolved stages of pkmn that evolved under his care count as well as the current stages
3. What about his own pkmn's pre-evolved forms that he didn't own? ex: Ash met Primeape as a Mankey, but it evolved into Primeape before he caught it.
> Y - If Ash met the pkmn and it evolved before being caught by him, the evo stage Ash met the pkmn in counts too
4. What about cases like Ambipom, which Ash caught as an Aipom but then traded to Dawn, and only evolved to Ambipom under Dawn's care? 
> N - It evolved when it was no longer his
5. Does Ash's Rotom phone count? 
> Y - Rule of funny
6. Does Mimey count? 
> N - It's not his, and doesn't even obey him
7. How about companions of Ash that he never officially caught? 
> M - He needs to have used them in battle
8. Pokemon caught for a contest and then released under contest rules? 
> Y - He did catch it, so sure
9. Do Ride pokemon Ash has used in Alola count? 
> N - Ride pkmn aren't owned by the player
10. Do pkmn formally lent to Ash for battle count? ex: The Pokémon League entrance exam 
> N - They aren't his, they are rentals**
11. Do pkmn formally lent to Ash for a non-battle contest count? 
> N
12. Do pkmn Ash informally borrowed count?
> N - He doesn't own them
13. How about the Raticate Ash traded his Butterfree for? Didn’t catch himself in the wild, didn’t use it for battle, traded back immediately
> Y: It was his briefly and officially, so yes
14. You mentioned they have to have been caught by Ash or used in a battle but you also said neither is necessary if the mon was "officially" his at some point, however briefly (like with Raticate).  Ash hatched a Larvitar egg but never caught with a ball and never used in battle, Does it count?
> Y: By game's standards, Larvitar had his OT so it counts
15. Do manga exclusives count? ex: Ash's Fearow
16. Does the newspaper strip count? In it, he has a Clefairy.
17. If yes to above: does Starmie count? He caught Misty's Starmie in a pokeball by mistake (which is apparently possible in the newspaper strip???)
