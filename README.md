## Pory Questionnare answers
1. Do Ash's Pokemon have to be currently under his ownership, or is it just any pokemon he's ever had, no matter how briefly? 
<br>**Pory: The pkmn must have battled under Ash's name or been caught in a pokeball by Ash**
2. What about previously evolved forms? ex: he had a Charmander/Charmeleon but it evolved to Charizard 
<br>**Pory: Y - the pre-evolved stages of pkmn that evolved under his care count as well as the current stages** 
3. What about his own pkmn's pre-evolved forms that he didn't own? ex: Ash met Primeape as a Mankey, but it evolved into Primeape before he caught it.
<br>**Pory: Y - If Ash met the pkmn and it evolved before being caught by him, the evo stage Ash met the pkmn in counts too**
4. What about cases like Ambipom, which Ash caught as an Aipom but then traded to Dawn, and only evolved to Ambipom under Dawn's care? 
<br>**Pory: N - It evolved when it was no longer his**
5. Does Ash's Rotom phone count? 
<br>**Pory: Y - Rule of funny**
6. Does Mimey count? 
<br>**Pory: N - It's not his, and doesn't even obey him**
7. How about companions of Ash that he never officially caught? 
<br>**Pory: M - He needs to have used them in battle**
8. Pokemon caught for a contest and then released under contest rules? 
<br>**Pory: Y - He did catch it, so sure**
9. Do Ride pokemon Ash has used in Alola count? 
<br>**Pory: N - Ride pkmn aren't owned by the player**
10. Do pkmn formally lent to Ash for battle count? ex: The Pokémon League entrance exam 
<br>**Pory: N - They aren't his, they are rentals**
11. Do pkmn formally lent to Ash for a non-battle contest count? 
<br>**Pory: N**
